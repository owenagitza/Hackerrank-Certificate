# Hackerrank Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio of Hackerrank challenges and certifications in Python and SQL. I documented all of my attempts and solutions in solving all Python and SQL challenges inside Python Notebooks. In the end, I succeeded to complete all of the certifications. I managed this repository for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.
